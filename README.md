Hi there! Welcome to my User Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project! 

  

This application is built using a bootstrap grid system and a sprinkle of  

personal css styling! It is designed as a mobile-first development project!

The Strategy.. 

Inspiration and Research 

  

For design inspiration I searched web design award websites such as  

www.awwwards.com, https://blog.hubspot.com/ and www.smashingmagazine.com 

  

The project is  adopted from this award winning fashion website:  

  

https://global-fashion-group.com/ 

Since the launch of GFG in 2011, they have been dedicated to being the #1 fashion  

and lifestyle destination in thier market. They are at the forefront of technology  

innovation and curated products in an environment thatâ€™s tailored to local market needs. 

  

I decided to follow a single-page application approach and adopt the main features 

and sections from the GFG website. 

  

----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

  

The Scope.. 

The application will include a Landing Section with navbar. 

  

The main body of content will include: 

About Section 

Market Section 

Brand Section 

News Section  

  

The footer will include social media links and a form to request an online cataloge. 

  

----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

  

The Structure.. 

The main objective is to replace the more complex components of the GFG website with  

techniques learned in the User Centric Frontend Module. 

First decision is to introduce a responsive Bootstrap NavBar. 

To maintain the UI layout I decided to replace the main carousel with a Bootstrap  

carousel. The remaining two carousels will be replaced with static images. 

The main body of content will be built with the Bootstrap Grid system for  

mobile responsive design. 

  

----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

  

The Skeleton.. 

Two wireframes of the landing page in mobile and desktop format are created to help 

visualise the grid layout. This concept can then be adopted for the rest of the layout. 

  

----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

  

The Surface.. 

  

add Landing navbar and images, made mobile responsive 

add link tags for:  

   	bootstrap CDN 

   	fontawesome 

   	hover.css 

add script tags for: 

   	jquery.com 

   	popper.js 

   	bootstrap 

   	jquery-smooth-scroll 

changed large Landing image with bootstrap carousel 

add Landing logo and content 

add fonts "Roboto", "Exo" and "Montserrat" from https://fonts.googleapis 

add About section, add Affiliate section 

add and style footer details 

add Markets section, refactor html and css after mentor session 

add Brand section 

add News section, add News images 

download and resize images for Landing section 

add request form to footer (this feature requires a little JS to function correctly) 

  

----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

  

Testing.. 

  

The project was initially built in C9 but I had reoccurring issues with  

the relative file paths and so move the project to local drive and  

edited using sublime. To refactor the code I used a sublime package called 

HTML/CSS/JS Prettify. 

  

NavBar 

My main issue is with the current bootstrap navBar on responsive setting for  

the iPad. I cannot change the JS for this element and will replace the  

navBar in the next upgrade after completing the Interactive Frontend Development 

module. I can only toggle the dropdown with the dropdown button and not with 

the nav-items. This will also be resolved in the next upgrade. NavBar anchors are 

tested and working. 

  

Landing Section 

Carousel image and aside images working properly for Galaxys5, Pixel2, iPhone5/6/7/8 

and desktop. Addition media queries required to resolve Pixel2 XL, iPad and iPad pro. 

  

Main Content 

All the sections in the main content are mobile responsive and tested for all devices. 

The anchor tags all return to the Landing content. They will link to further content 

or more dropdown content in the next upgrade. 

  

Footer 

Social media links open the main twitter and linkedin websites on a new browser 

window. The catalogue form is tested to require all input fields and to check that 

the email supplied is in the correct format for an email address. The submit 

button returns to the landing content. This will return a confirmation notification 

after the next upgrade.
